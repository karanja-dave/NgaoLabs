**Applied Data Science & AI. Learn by Building**

Applied Data Science and AI projects from the NgaoLabs program, focused on Context-driven African solutions, end-to-end workflows, and deployable solutions over a structured 10-week skill building program.

---

## Overview

This repository contains practical projects, experiments, and learning artifacts developed under the **NgaoLabs Data Science & AI program**. The program spans 10 weeks, covering foundational theory, practical coding skills, applied machine learning, and capstone project development.

The focus is on **problem-driven solutions** grounded in real-world contexts, particularly within Africa, with emphasis on:

* Practical problem framing
* Data acquisition and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model development and evaluation
* Responsible AI practices
* Reproducible workflows

## Philosophy

This repository prioritizes:

* **Understanding over abstraction**
* **End-to-end thinking over isolated models**
* **Problem-solving outputs over academic perfection**

Every project aims to answer: *What real problem does this solve, and for whom?*
